## ðŸŸ¢ BuyBot
**What it does:** Lets you buy tokens with your chosen wallets. You pick the wallets, the token (by ticker or contract address), and the amount. You can use normal mode (buy all at once) or TWAP mode (spread your buy over time). Just fill in the boxes and hit start!

## ðŸ”´ SellBot
**What it does:** Lets you sell tokens from your wallets. Choose which wallets and tokens to sell, and how much. You can sell all at once, use TWAP to sell slowly, or use FSH mode to sell everything super fast. Just select, enter, and go.

## ðŸšœ FarmBot
**What it does:** Helps you "farm" (make lots of small trades) to boost your trading volume. Pick a wallet, token, and amount, and FarmBot will do the rest. Great for volume farming competitions.

## ðŸ’¥ FSH (Flash Sell All)
**What it does:** Sells every token in your wallets (except VIRTUAL/TRUST) as fast as possible. Just pick your wallets and hit FSHâ€”no need to pick tokens.

## ðŸš€ JeetBot
**What it does:** Watches for new tokens from a special "genesis" contract and buys them instantly when they launch. You just enter the genesis contract or ticker, pick your wallets, and JeetBot does the rest. You can also use REBUY mode to buy back after a price drop.

## ðŸ“Š MMbot (Market Maker)
**What it does:** Automatically buys low and sells high for a single token. You set the buy/sell ranges and amounts, and MMbot keeps trading for you. Great for making profit from price swings.
